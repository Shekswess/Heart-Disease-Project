    "## Dataset\n",
    "For this problem I will work with the Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What topic does the dataset cover?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect \"patterns\" from the data that can predict a patient's condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where did the dataset come from and what treatments did it undergo?\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the dataset come from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents. As the CDC describes: \"Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.\". The most recent dataset (as of February 15, 2022) includes data from 2020. It consists of 401,958 rows and 279 columns. The vast majority of columns are questions asked to respondents about their health status, such as \"Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\" or \"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life? [Note: 5 packs = 100 cigarettes]\". In this dataset, I noticed many different factors (questions) that directly or indirectly influence heart disease, so I decided to select the most relevant variables from it and do some cleaning so that it would be usable for machine learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What can you do with this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, the original dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to just about 20 variables. In addition to classical EDA, this dataset can be used to apply a range of machine learning methods, most notably classifier models (logistic regression, SVM, random forest, etc.). You should treat the variable \"HeartDisease\" as a binary (\"Yes\" - respondent had heart disease; \"No\" - respondent had no heart disease). But note that classes are not balanced, so the classic model application approach is not advisable. Fixing the weights/undersampling should yield significantly betters results."

    "### KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN algorithm is one of the simples and easiest to implement supervised ML algorithms. It can be used for classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm works on assuming that similar things with similar features are in close proximity to each other. The value of k when working with this algorithm is too important. To get the best value for k, usually ML Engineers get the number of entries in the dataset(n) and sqrt it, so k = sqrt(n). So for values of k closer to 1 we get less stable predictions, because in general KNN works as majority voting. So with increasing the values of K we are going to get better results to a certain point when the results will start to get worse. The bad thing for this algorithm in general is because it's slower compared to other algorithms. Because it's slower this algorithm works better with smaller datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Tree Algorithm (explanation only for Random Forest Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree Algorithm is one of the most simples algorithm that is in use in the Machine Learning. It it a basis for most other ML algorithm like Random Tree and Random Forest. The idea is simple, it starts with the feature that plays a big role in the classifing and braches out using other features. Basically it's answering the questions with yes or no(1 or 0). This is a typical algorithm used for classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for the Random Forest Algorithm is quite interesting and powerful. Random Forest uses many trees in combination so it can get the right conclussion or with other words: A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models. The low correlation between models is the key. Uncorrelated models can produce ensemble predictions that are more accurate than any of the individual predictions. The reason for this wonderful effect is that the trees protect each other from their individual errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes Algorithm\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem. Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive. There are basically 3 types of naive bayes: Multinomial Naive Bayes for basic classfication problems, Bernoulli Naive Bayes  is similar to the multinomial naive bayes but the predictors are boolean variables and Gaussian Naive Bayes when the predictors take up a continuous value and are not discrete, we assume that these values are sampled from a gaussian distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### XGBoost Algorithm\n",
    "XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. Generally, XGBoost is fast. Really fast when compared to other implementations of gradient boosting. XGBoost can be used for classification and regression problems. It's extremely popular for competitions. This algorithm goes by lots of different names such as gradient boosting, multiple additive regression trees, stochastic gradient boosting or gradient boosting machines. Boosting is an ensemble technique where new models are added to correct the errors made by existing models. Models are added sequentially until no further improvements can be made. A popular example is the AdaBoost algorithm that weights data points that are hard to predict. Gradient boosting is an approach where new models are created that predict the residuals or errors of prior models and then added together to make the final prediction. It is called gradient boosting because it uses a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the loss when adding new models."
